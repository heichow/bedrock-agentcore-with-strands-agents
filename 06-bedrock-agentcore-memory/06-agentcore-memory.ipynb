    "\n",
    "### Short-Term Memory: \n",
    "\n",
    "Short-term memory captures raw interaction events, maintains immediate context, powers real-time conversations, enriches long-term memory systems, and enables building advanced contextual solutions such as multi-step task completion, in-session knowledge accumulation, and context-aware decision making.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Synchronous storage** - Messages saved immediately during conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Configurable retention** - Automatically expires after specified period (from 7 to 365 days)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Long-Term Memory: \n",
    "\n",
    "Long-term memory stores structured information extracted from raw agent interactions, which is retained across multiple sessions. Instead of saving all raw conversation data, long-term memory preserves only the key insights such as summaries of the conversations, facts and knowledge (semantic memory), or user preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The memory pipeline is an asynchronous process that runs in the background and automatically extracts insights after raw conversation/context is stored in Short Term Memory via CreateEvent. This efficiently consolidates key information without interrupting live interactions. \n",
